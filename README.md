Used the Sentiment140 dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140/data 
To analyze sentiment through text using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifiers.
The goal is to predict the sentiment of tweets based on text data.
This repository contains code for performing this sentiment analysis and includes:
Data processing in terms of cleaning text, removing common words and using TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
A word cloud is created to prove that the text is properly cleaned and is ready for the models to use.
Training the Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models on this data and gauging performance through accuracy calculation and confusion matrices.
Analysis of the models performance, including listing the words most identified with positive and negative sentiment to prove the model is properly making patterns out of the data.
This project uses jupyter and the python libraries pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, scipy, wordcloud, and matplotlib.
